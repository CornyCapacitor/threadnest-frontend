# ThreadNest ðŸ§µ
**ThreadNest** is my first project that integrates a separately built Next.js frontend hosted on Vercel with an Express.js backend, using Mongoose and MongoDB for database management. The project was created to test my full-stack development skills, and I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of managing both sides of the application. I started by developing the backend, but the real challenge came when I began working on the frontend. I quickly realized how many adjustments were needed on the backend to meet the frontendâ€™s requirements. Despite these hurdles, the process was incredibly rewarding. While there are still areas for improvement, I was eager to implement my own authentication system using JWT tokens.
